        <h2>Torah Scholar, Leader, and Visionary</h2>

        <p>Rabbi Haim Amsellem is this generation's leading rabbinic scholar on conversion to Judaism and the founder of the Am Shalem movement. The author of over 40 books on Torah literature, his standout achievement is <em>Zera Yisrael</em>, the most important halakhic book on conversion in over 100 years.</p>

        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Rabbi Haim (Emile) Amsellem was born on October 12, 1959, in Oran, French Algeria, to David and Freha Amsellem, who immigrated there from Morocco. When he was six months old, his family moved to Lyon, France, where he grew up until the age of 11. In 1970, the family immigrated to Israel.</p>

        <h3>Education and Rabbinic Career</h3>
        <p>Rabbi Amsellem graduated from Yeshivat Kisse Rahamim and was ordained as a rabbi at age 20 by the dean of the yeshiva, Rabbi Meir Mazuz, and the late Rishon LeTzion, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.</p>

        <p>In 1990, he obtained certification as a rabbinical legal representative ("to'en rabbani"), and in 1993, he was ordained a City Rabbi by the Chief Rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.</p>

        <p>In 1982 he married Hannah, the granddaughter of Rabbi Nissim Cohen, Av Beit Din in Djerba, Tunisia.</p>

        <h3>Rabbinical Positions</h3>
        <p>After his marriage, Rabbi Amsellem served in various rabbinic positions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rabbi of Sharsheret moshav for seven years</li>
          <li>Neighborhood rabbi in Netivot</li>
          <li>Head of Yeshiva of "Ohalei Yaakov ve Tifereth Israel"</li>
          <li>Head of the kollel "Baba Sali" in Netivot</li>
          <li>Founder of "Shirei David" Kollel in Har Nof, Jerusalem, named after his father</li>
          <li>Rabbi of the Sephardic Jewish community "Heichal Haness" in Geneva, Switzerland</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Political Career</h3>
        <p>A founding member of Shas, Rabbi Amsellem was first elected to the Israeli Knesset in 2006 and was re-elected in 2009.</p>

        <p>Following ideological differences with party leadership regarding issues of Torah study combined with work, military service equality, and conversion policies, he resigned from Shas in 2011. With a renewed Zionist vision, he established the Am Shalem movement, dedicated to combating religious extremism, fighting for equal army service among all Israelis, and promoting a more inclusive approach to Jewish identity.</p>

        <h3>Am Shalem Movement</h3>
        <p>Am Shalem ("The Complete Nation") calls itself a "Jewish social movement." The movement advocates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Moderate Judaism that integrates Torah study with earning a living</li>
          <li>Equality in sharing the burden of military service</li>
          <li>Reform of the structure and authority of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel</li>
          <li>A lenient Halakhic approach regarding conversion to Judaism</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conversion Advocacy</h3>
        <p>One of Rabbi Amsellem's primary focuses has been making the conversion process more accessible and less stressful for sincere converts. He was one of the founding rabbis of Giyur keHalacha and has founded Ahavat HaGer, an organization dedicated to ensuring that converts can go through the conversion process with dignity and support.</p>

        <p>His groundbreaking work <em>Zera Yisrael</em> provides halakhic foundations for a more welcoming approach to those seeking to join the Jewish people, while maintaining fidelity to Jewish law and tradition.</p>

        <h3>Literary Works</h3>
        <p>Rabbi Amsellem has authored over 40 books on Torah literature, covering topics including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Jewish law (Halakha)</li>
          <li>Conversion to Judaism</li>
          <li>Jewish identity and community</li>
          <li>Torah commentary</li>
        </ul>
